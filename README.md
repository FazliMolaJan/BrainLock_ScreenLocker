# Brain Lock : OTK ScreenLocker

--------

### What is Brain Lock?

OTK means 'One Time Keypad' that is a method of applying a OTP, a password security system, to an offline lock screen on mobile.

BrainLock is a MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) security technology that adds HI (Human Intelligence) to the existing convenient password by entering a password using a random keypad and a null keypad. BrainLock not only meets usability, security and portability, but also improves user memory.



### How it works?

After a moment, the numbers on the buttons are hidden and with each input, the positions of the nine input buttons are rearranged.
